-- Uniform are mandatory

1. Discipline
Everything seems to become so violent at once that you can't take a step aside. And the atmosphere becomes very harsh and monotonously
2. Uncomfortable
It can be quite uncomfortable to wear the same thing every day, and even more if these clothes are made of low-quality materials
3. Creative spark
Wearing a uniform restricts students from choosing their own style. And it doesn't even give them the opportunity to express their creativity.

-- Uniform are not mandatory
1. Comfortable 
You can wear whatever you want and not worry about whether it complies with the dress code or school uniform. It's also convenient because you can sit in class in whatever you want, if it's cold in a jacket or even if it's hot. But even if you want to, you can come in uniform.
2. Freedom
I've already sad about this
3. Teachers
It is equally important that if a school decides to abolish uniforms, teachers and others should be aware of this and not start conflicts over the clothes you wear or treat you differently because of your uniform


-- Uniforms at school competitions
1. Unity
Uniforms at school competitions create unity among the students who compete.
2. Brand
And for the school it is important that everyone understands that, for example, this school won the competition, people remember the emblem or name and know that it is a good school and they should go there to study, it is just a marketing tool


-- Cost
And if the school forces me to wear a uniform, then let them issue it, because it is more necessary for the school than for me

-- Conclusion
And my conclusion is that I am against wearing school uniforms because it is no longer something modern, not comfortable. But I do not mind if it is necessary to wear it for some school competitions. I'm for, like in our school we have uniforms that are required, but you can no wear them, and the big advantage is that our uniform is just a T-shirt, and that's it.
